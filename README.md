# Terminal_Based_Sudoku
This is my first C++ project. Part of my contribution to a group project for 4007 CEM - CompSci Activity Led Learning Project 2. 

The task was to create a Terminal game with no graphics. We decided to make a text-based adventure game. The idea was to have multiple rooms that are locked, and to unlock them the player would have to face a challenge (a.k.a. a mini game/puzzle). My sudoku is one of the mini games. I also contributed to the main code, the code planning and the databases.



As of today(28.06.2021) the sudoku game is nearly finished. Debugging is in progress. Current bug case is as follows:
The while loop in the header file does not break, which leads to a state in which the player cannot enter anything, because everything is filled.
