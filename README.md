# Terminal_Based_Sudoku
This is my first C++ project. Part of my contribution to a group project for 4007 CEM - CompSci Activity Led Learning Project 2. 
The task was to create a Terminal game with no graphics. We decided to make a text-based adventure game. The idea was to have multiple rooms that are locked, and to unlock them the player would have to face a challenge (a.k.a. a mini game/puzzle). My sudoku is one of the mini games. I also contributed to the main code, the code planning and the databases.
